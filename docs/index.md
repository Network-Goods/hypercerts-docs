# Introduction to HyperCerts

> *HyperCerts help build and scale retrospective reward systems for impact.*


HyperCerts are like carbon credits, but on any impact vector. While carbon credits are not perfect, they allow to reward projects for positive outcomes retrospectively, i.e. when these outcomes are observable. HyperCerts enable this for other impact areas, such as education, healthcare, AI safety and open source software.

# Why retrospective funding based on HyperCerts is needed
* Roughly half of the time of Impact Entrepreneurs is spent raising money. 
* Incentives to achieve impact post-funding are lower in public goods than in for-profit organizations
* Impact is hardly tangible, can't be transfered and can't be traded.

## Benefits for Stakeholders
* **Contributors** use HyperCerts to increase their impact's visibility, tangibility, and fundability.
* **Funders** use HyperCerts to increase transparency, reduce transaction costs, and increase visibility as well as managability of their portfolio
  * **Early-stage Funders** use HyperCerts to rapidly fund Contributors. Tracability and evaluations reduce transaction costs when trading impact in the form of HyperCerts with Retrospective Funders
  * **Retrospective Funders** use HyperCerts to buy evaluated impact with minimal transaction costs, knowing their funding supports a thriving ecosystem without barriers of entry.

## How HyperCerts work

Each HyperCert represents a public goods claim, comprising of effort and impact. As a model for public goods, HyperCerts work with a hyperspace that has these dimensions:
* **Scope of Work**: What work was done?
* **Time of Work**: When was it done?
* **Scope of Impact**: What impacts does the work cause?
* **Time of Impact**: When do these impacts materialize?
* **Rights**: What rights to work and impact come with the HyperCert?

Each HyperCert is a claim to a subset of that space. Itemizing impact increases transparency, reduces transaction consts and introduces easy tradeability.

### Fractions
Typical scenarios in impact funding require shared ownership of Impact, think with funders working together or portions of a HyprCert being traded.
To realize this, HyperCerts are semi-fungible and one of the first implementations of [EIP-3525](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3525). HyperCerts consist of Fractions and each of these Fractions is an NFT ([EIP-721](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721)) that can be transferred and traded. The Fractions of HyperCerts are intended to be traded easily, e.g. on OpenSea.
