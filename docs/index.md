# Introduction to HyperCerts

> *HyperCerts are a tool to build scalable retrospective reward systems for impact.*


HyperCerts are like carbon credits, but on any impact vector. While carbon credits are not perfect, they allow to reward projects for positive outcomes retrospectively, i.e. when these outcomes are observable. HyperCerts enable this for other impact areas, such as education, healthcare, AI safety and open source software.

# Why retrospective funding based on HyperCerts is needed
* We currently don't have strong incentives for high-risk/high-potential public goods as many Impact Entrepreneurs are financed by grants that are based on costs instead of rewards that are increasing in the impact created.
* Impact entrepreneurs jump from grant to grant, wasting their energy on raising money as they don't have recurring income streams to sustain and scale their operations.
* Too much talent is wasted in profitable, low-impact work â€“ we need to change the reward systems to attract more of that talent to building public goods.

## Some Benefits for Stakeholders
* **Contributors** use HyperCerts to increase their impact's visibility, tangibility, and fundability. Contributions from multiple contributors become accountable easily.
* **Funders** use HyperCerts to increase transparency, reduce transaction costs, and increase visibility as well as managability of their portfolio.
  * **Prospective Funders** use HyperCerts to rapidly fund contributors early. Tracability and evaluations reduce transaction costs when exchanging impact in the form of HyperCerts with retrospective funders.
  * **Retrospective Funders** use HyperCerts to buy evaluated impact with minimal transaction costs and under minimal uncertainty, knowing their funding enables a thriving impact ecosystem with low barriers of entry.

## Potential Dynamics in a HyperCert Ecosystem with Retrospective Funding

## How HyperCerts work

Each HyperCert represents an impact claim described by these dimensions:
* **Scope of Work**: What work has been or will be done?
* **Time of Work**: When has the work been done or will it be done?
* **Scope of Impact**: What has the work impacted or will impact?
* **Time of Impact**: When has this impact occured or will occur?
* **Rights**: What are the rights of the owners of the HyperCert?

These dimensions create the public goods hyperspace. Each HyperCert is a claim to a subset of that space. This also means for example that a HyperCert for a specific work doesn't need to include every impact that this work has had or will have. Itemizing impact increases transparency, reduces transaction costs and allows traceability.

### Fractions
Typical scenarios in impact funding require multiple contributors and funders working together. But it doesn't happen often enough. With HyperCerts we want to make this easier. That is why HyperCerts are semi-fungible and one of the first implementations of [EIP-3525](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3525). Each HyperCert can be split into multiple fractions of different sizes. Each of these fractions is an NFT ([EIP-721](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721)) and hence compatible with other applications.
