* Collect examples in this [HyperCerts Examples Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Q3ZA4o4U-ZB9UMH0OnEFDDf7jSTtb2jj8kO24ljvNso/edit?usp=sharing)

## Questions / Edge Cases
* Is a HyperCert's SoW (scope of work) affected by other HyperCert's SoW? Example: Materials vs. time vs. project management vs. referrals vs. marketing.
* How does the market reward the best actions? E.g. if 100 people work on a project, how is the supply of HyperCerts limited, how are buyers incentivized?
  * The more common situation will be that an organization aggregates all contributions into a single HyperCert
* If we use A && !B && !C to scope work/impact for a project P:=A+B+C, 

* Any? => [] (it's an empty list)
* Forever? Time axis is finite, forever is maximum timestamp (reflect on uint[x])
* Overlapping symbols? Separate coding between work and impact
* Scope of impact is ANY / `[]` by default. The main reason to divert (i.e. have a more granular scope of impact) is if we expect different types of funders that want to pay for different types of impact
* How do we avoid situations where random contributors reclaim parts of an already claimed HyperCert ("my contribution wasn't valued properly, here's what I also did") (and possibly selling it to their more engaged audience)?
* It's the evaluator's job to avoid conflicts and overlaps. If that process fails, the contributor could publish an evaluation on their own (would be a rather adversarial step)
* Market dynamics: time of hypercert issuance could become a point of contention. Can we help solve these kinds of market dynamics issues at a structural product-design level, rather than leaving them for each project to solve?

## Next steps

- [ ] @bitbeckers: Translate example from spreadsheet to documentation
- [ ] @holkeB? For promising cert ideas which are not associated with actual projects done by actual groups of people, identify some such groups that did the sort of thing described in the idea (or similar/adjacent work), with an eye toward then filling out a complete hypercert minting form on their behalf and pitching it to them
