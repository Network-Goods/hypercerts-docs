| Term | Description | Instead of |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| Contributors     | The parties contributing to a unit of impact claimed by a *hypercert*.      | ~~impact cert~~, ~~HyperCert~~    |
| Fraction     | Represents a tradeable part of a hypercert. Can be split further, Fractions of the same hypercert can be merged into a larger fraction. Fractions are implemented as [semi-fungible (EIP-3525)](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3525) → *tokens*. | ~~Token~~ |
| Funder     | Any party buying *fractions* of a *hypercert* or promising to do so (*retrospective funder*).      | ~~Donor~~ |
| Funder, retrospective     | Any party promising to buy *fractions* of a *hypercert*.      | ~~retroactive funder~~ |

Hypercerts consist of 1...n *fractions*. See also [the hypercert ledger](ledger) br /> <br/>Under the hood, a *hypercert* corresponds to a *slot* as defined in [EIP-3525](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3525).      | ~~impact cert~~, ~~impact claim~~, ~~slot~~, ~~HyperCert~~    |
| Impact     | Not defined by the protocol but negotiated between *minters* and *funders*.      | |
| Minter     | The party minting a *hypercert*      | ~~Impact Creator~~ |
| Slot     | Important implementation detail. Hypercerts are represented by slots as defined in [EIP-3525](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3525). All *fractions* (tokens) assigned to the same slot form a *hypercert*.       |  |
| Token     | Important Implementation detail. Tokens represent *fraction* and are the tradeable unit of a *hypercert*. |  |
