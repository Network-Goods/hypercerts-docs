Quadratic voting, bargaining solutions, DAO-style votes, milestone bounties, and simple unconditional grants all have their strengths, among others. We do not wish to lock in any particular decision-making scheme for funders. Without mechanisms like these, multi-funder coordination on impact funding is prohibitively expensive, leading to suboptimal efficiency in impact capital allocation.
