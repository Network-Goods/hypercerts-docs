This is important because the optimal funding decisions of a single funder depends on the funding decision of all other funders. For instance, some work is only impactful if a minimum funding is provided: The impact is non-linear in the funding amount, e.g. half a bridge is not half as impactful as a full bridge. Other work might be over-funded, i.e. the impact of an additional dollar is basically zero. Ultimately, funders want to find the highest impact for each additional dollar spend (cf. S-process as in Critch, 2021). Today multi-funder coordination on impact funding is prohibitively expensive, leading to suboptimal efficiency in impact capital allocation.  Through hypercerts the funding becomes more transparent and the credits for funding impactful work can be easily shared.
